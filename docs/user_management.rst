User management
===============

The security part is quite incomplete at the moment,
and the main benefit of user registration is that check execution
history is stored with the name of the user triggering the check.

Users and authentication
------------------------

Authentication is done with django-allauth (https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Please refer to that documentation for all configuration details.

Django Admin
------------

To create a Django superuser with full admin panel access,
execute the standard command

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py createsuperuser


Default groups
--------------

There are some default groups that you might want to use
(https://github.com/yoyowallet/inspector/blob/master/inspector/base/management/commands/default_auth_groups.py)

To enable these, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py default_auth_groups
